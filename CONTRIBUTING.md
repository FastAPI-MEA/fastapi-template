So, we'll go straight to the point. Intros are for weak folks.

## Wait first...
I, the creator of this repository, am the 
[Benevolent Dictator For Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life) 
as it pertains to this project. This is actually important as you will see. 
I'll call it the BDFL.

## How do I contribute?
It starts from issues first. 
Issues are created and if vetted by the BDFL (for now), 
you can go on to create a pull request for it. 
The name of the PR branches are very important and should follow a pattern:
- If it is a new feature: should be named: f-\<number of the issue>
- If it is a bug: should be named: b-\<number of the issue>
- Anything else: should be named: e-\<number of the issue>

## FAQs
Everything needs a FAQ.
1. "I think we need to add a new feature!" : 
  Yeah, create an issue for it and everyone will talk about it
2. "These rules are dumb and should be better" : 
  Yeah, create an issue for it and everyone will talk about it
3. "I hate this project" : 
  Nice, [send me a mail](mailto:adeoti.15.jude@gmail.com) and we'll 
  talk about it.

Danke! ðŸ”¥
